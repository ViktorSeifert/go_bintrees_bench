# Programs from The Computer Language Benchmarks Game
This package, together with the sub-packages, provides programs from "The Computer Language Benchmarks Game".

I've just made small modifications so that the functions can be called from the benchmarks (e.g. changing the package name or filename, moving functions so they can be exported).

I also added some benchmarks to measure runtime performace.
